First and foremost, I would like to thank my mom, my dad and my brother for always believing in me.

Next, I would like to thank my supervisors Octavian, Gary and Paulina for all the useful discussions. I would also like to thank the Data Analytics Lab and the Leonhard cluster for GPU access and free coffee.

A big thank you goes to Gorjan and Ondrej for all their advice, useful discussions and comments on the thesis text. I would also like to thank Igor for his constant support.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank Tina for the never-ending support and for simply being there for me.
